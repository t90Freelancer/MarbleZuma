Hi!
I'll tell you how to create your own Zuma-like game, using my script system, based on BezierCurves.
There are some simple rules:
1) All params, which can influence on gameplay, is correctable in inspector.
2) It is nesessarry to place some prefabs on scene (i'll tell about it in future).
3) If you not understand some things (like a params in script), firstly view source code. I am strived to comment all public variables.

So, let's start.
1) Create a scene in Unity.
2) Place a BezierPathController prefab (all prefabs stored in Assets\Resources\Prefabs).
3) Place some control points on scene (BezierCotrolPointPrefab) and set links to their in PathController (ControlPoints field).
When you done it, you'll see line of ball movement in editor. (of course, if you enabled DebugBezierPath option in PathController).
You can change desinig curve if you'll move control points.
WARNING: Minimal amount of control point is 5. (Bacause it is a curve of 3-exponent).
4) Place
 -BallsCannon
 -BallsFactory
 -BallsTrap
 -GlobalGameManager
prefabs and set params, which you need. It is nesessarry to set links between theirs in inspector.
 You must set all params. Use my scene as example.

PS: there is a simple way to create you own scene. Just copy my scene and correct it. There are all links are setted as needs.
